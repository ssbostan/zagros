# ZagrOS (Zagros Open Source Operating System)

**The tenth anniversary of starting the ZagrOS project.**

Ten years ago, in 2012, I started developing this tiny operating system for educational purposes. This project is dedicated to my dear university teacher **Mr Amir Sedghamiz** for teaching me the necessary concepts of operating systems and encouraging me to develop this project. Developing this OS is inspired by my learnings from two golden books of Operating Systems by William Stallings and Andrew S. Tanenbaum.
